# SuperHeroesListViewer
Init

Schoolproject.

Goal was to create a list view of a personclass and to be able to sort the list using:
* JavaFX
* ListView
* Sorting functions
* Use of lambda expressions

I decided to go with a Super Hero theme and added som extra features:
* Load heroes from a database
* Save list to .CSV file
* Extra menu
* Feature to add new heroes
* Dialog boxes for feedback
